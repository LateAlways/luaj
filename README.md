# luaj
My own version of lua. Keep in mind this is my first time doing a "programming language".

### This works with roblox just put it in a modulescript

### Info
- This "programming language" is like a mix of LUA/LUAU, JavaScript and Java.

### DOCS - will not differ much from lua
To make a multiline comment you can use "/*" and to close it "*/"
you can also use "//" to make a end-line comment.

To declare a variable you can use "var".
To declare a function you can use "func"
